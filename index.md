I am a Courant Instructor at New York University, sponsored by [Christopher Musco](chrismusco.com/).
I have a joint appoinment with [Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at Courant and [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at Tandon.


Broadly, my research aims to develop methods to support the scientists taking on the problems of today.

I'm particularly interested in incorporating probabilistic techniques into classical algorithms to develop methods which are fast and reliable, both in theory and in practice.
Right now, I work mainly in the field of numerical linear algebra on Krylov subspace methods such as the conjugate gradient and Lanczos methods.
I hope that my work will help to bridge the gap between numerical analysis, theoretical computer science, and applied computational sciences such as quantum physics.


I am committed to making my research accessible and to facilitating the reproducibility/replicability of my work. 
Code to generate the figures from my papers can be found on [Github](https://github.com/chentyl).
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.


More information can be found in my [curriculum vitae (cv)](./cv.pdf).


## Collaboration

I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on (and people to collaborate with).

If you're an undergrad student in the NYC area interested in research or grad school, please feel free to reach out. 


## Thesis

I did my PhD in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](amath.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington where I was advised by [Anne Greenbaum](https://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/) and [Tom Trogdon](https://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/).
