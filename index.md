<img id="profile" src="./profile.jpg">

I'm an *Applied Research Lead* on the quantum-inspired and randomized algorithms team at [Global Technology Applied Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/applied-research), JPMorganChase.
Broadly, I work on the design and analysis of fast (in theory and practice) randomized algorithms for core linear algebra tasks.

I was previously a Assistant Professor / Courant Instructor at New York University (sponsored by [Chris Musco](https://chrismusco.com/)) and a PhD student in Applied Math  at the University of Washington (advised by [Anne Greenbaum](https://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/) and [Tom Trogdon](https://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/)).
Even earlier, I was an undergrad at Tufts University, where I studied math, physics, and studio art.


An overview of my research interests along with more detailed introductions to particular directions can be found [here](./intros).
Code to generate the figures from my papers can be found on [Github](https://github.com/tchen-research).
Please feel free to contact me with any questions about my research.

I am happy with "they" or "he" as pronouns.
