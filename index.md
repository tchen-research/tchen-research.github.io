description: I'm Tyler Chen! This page contains some basic information about my research.
...

I am an *Assistant Professor / Courant Instructor* (postdoc) at New York University, sponsored by [Christopher Musco](chrismusco.com/).
I have a joint appoinment with [Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at Courant and [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at Tandon.


Broadly, my research aims to develop methods to support the scientists taking on the problems of today.
An overview of my research interests along with more detailed introductions to particular directions can be found [here](./intros) as well as by following the [intro] links on papers listed below.


I am committed to making my research accessible and to facilitating the reproducibility/replicability of my work. 
Code to generate the figures from my papers can be found on [Github](https://github.com/chentyl).
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.

More information can be found in my [curriculum vitae (cv)](./cv.pdf).


## Collaboration

I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on (and people to collaborate with). I'm especially interested in cross-disciplinary work.

I believe strongly in the value of undergraduate research and am currently working with a number of undergraduate students on research projects.

- Robert Chen (NYU)  
- Kevin Li (NYU)  
- Skai Nzeuton (Stuyvesant)  
- Yilu Pan (NYU)  
- Yixin Wang (NYU)  
- Qichen Xu (UW)  

If you're an undergrad student in the NYC area interested in research or grad school, please feel free to reach out.
