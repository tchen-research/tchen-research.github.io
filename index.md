<img id="profile" src="./profile.jpg">

I am an *Assistant Professor / Courant Instructor* (postdoc) at New York University, sponsored by [Christopher Musco](https://chrismusco.com/).
I have a joint appoinment with [Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at Courant and [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) at Tandon.
I got my PhD in [Applied Math](https://amath.washington.edu/) from the University of Washington, where I was advised by [Anne Greenbaum](https://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/) and [Tom Trogdon](https://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/).
Before that, I was an Math and Physics student at Tufts University.


Broadly, my research aims to develop methods to support the scientists taking on the problems of today by providing fast (in theory and practice) algorithms for core linear algebra tasks. 
An overview of my research interests along with more detailed introductions to particular directions can be found [here](./intros) as well as by following the links on papers listed below.


I am committed to making my research accessible and to facilitating the reproducibility/replicability of my work. 
Code to generate the figures from my papers can be found on [Github](https://github.com/tchen-research).
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.

Materials from my past applications and proposals can be found [here](./applications).

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on (and people to collaborate with). I'm especially interested in cross-disciplinary work.

I believe strongly in the value of undergraduate research and am currently working with a number of undergraduate students on research projects.

- Robert Chen (NYU)  
- Kevin Li (NYU)  
- Skai Nzeuton (Stuyvesant, next stop: undergrad at Cornell)  
- Yilu Pan (NYU Shanghai)  
- Yixin Wang (NYU)  
- [Qichen Xu](https://peterxqc.github.io/) (UW, next stop: PhD at U. Chicago)  

If you're an undergrad student in the NYC area interested in research or grad school, please feel free to reach out. While I don't currently have any research positions, I'm happy to discuss these things with you.

## Thesis

I did my PhD in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](amath.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. 
I was advised by [Anne Greenbaum](https://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/) and [Tom Trogdon](https://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/).
